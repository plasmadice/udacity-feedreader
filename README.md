# Project Overview
This project demonstrates Jasmine and it's testing capabilities. I've written several tests that will pass or fail depending on certain conditions.

## How it Works
Simply open index.html to start. The skeleton is provided by Udacity and is a functional RSS Feedreader. The list below (and Jasmine itself) give you an idea on what changes would cause a test to fail. Check out [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/index.html) for the documentation.

### So What is Jasmine Checking For?
1. Checking if **allFeeds** exists
2. Checking if each feed has a **URL**
3. Checking if each feed has a **name**
4. Confirming that the **hamburger menu** is hidden by default
5. Checking if the **hamburger menu** changes visibility when clicked
6. Checking if the **the initial entries** contains at least one entry
7. Confirming that a **new feed selection** changes the content on the page
